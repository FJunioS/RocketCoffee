### Personal challenges
**First time using JavaScript!**<br>
Even being a simple project, being able to research and find alone how to fix some problems and understand deeply how JS manipulates HTML was magical. 
At the end I did some notes, like:
* If more than one tag element shares the same class and you select it through `.querySelector`, JavaScript will select the first child only. 
* Try to avoid using _ifs_ and _elses_, this will make your code more _readable_.

**Organizing the folder** <br>
Obviously I will create soon an article to elaborate more about this topic, but as I was developing this project the necessity of organizing my files and making easier to find what I needed was crutial to speed up the whole process.
